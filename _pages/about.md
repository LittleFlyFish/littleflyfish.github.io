About Me 
======
I am currently a postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Edinburgh (The Alan Turing Institute). I've completed my Master and Bachelor degrees in Math at the University of Xi’an Jiaotong University and the University of Science and Technology of China. I obtained the PhD degree from NCCA (Top 1 Animation Institution in the UK) Bournemouth University in 2020. I won the Automation Fellowship from the South West Creative Technology Network (SWCTN) and was honoured as a New Talent candidate. Now my research interest includes graph neural networks, videos prediction, human motion understanding, human interaction understanding and spatial-temporal understanding.
